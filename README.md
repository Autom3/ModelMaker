# ModelMaker
The ModelMaker plugin

This plugin is for minecraft model creators! All you need is worldedit and this plugin, select the area you want to convert to a model with the worldedit wand, then type /make [filename]. This will create a file in this plugin's folder with a model of the area you've selected!

Command: /make [filename]

Permission: modelmaker.make

The config file contains a list of texture name to materials conversion. If a block and it's textures aren't in there, then the plugin won't know what to do with that block.
